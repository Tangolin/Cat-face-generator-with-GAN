### Cat face generator
---
This is a simple implementation of the GAN architecture. Borrowed heavily from the **Pytorch tutorial**.

Trained on a dataset with 30k images of cat faces. It learns to generate a 64 * 64 cat face image from a vector of 100 random numbers(honestly this part is pretty amazing to me).

The picture below is one of the best generated faces, while it is not the best, I still say it looks pretty good!
